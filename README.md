# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

In this challenge, I helped Jeremy and the data analytics team to do the following:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

This assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study :

# Deliverable 1:

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG :
The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle.Following is the ouput to design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file:

From the above output following are the questions which needs to be addresses :

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?


- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?


- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


# Deliverable 2:

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv dataset contains the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots. Following is the output of summary statistics table to show:

- The suspension coilâ€™s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots:-

- The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

For the aboce output we need to know :

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
